# Face-Mask-Detection
This project uses deep learning models to detect face masks with "mask detected" or "no mask detected". It includes a simple web GUI built with Gradio and deployed on Hugging Face for easy image uploads and real-time predictions.

Results: 
The project proved 94% accuracy using 10 epochs as the optimized number of epochs 

Steps to follow while creating a similar project: 

1- Importing liberaries 

2-Model Building 

3- Model compiling 

4-Model training 

5-Model testing 

Data set used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishjangra27/face-mask-12k-images-dataset/data

As for the GUI, Hugging face was used to design and launch it
